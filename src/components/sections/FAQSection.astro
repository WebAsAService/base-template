    question: "What is a fractional CFO and do I need one after raising?",
    answer:
      "A fractional CFO is a part-time finance lead who brings structure, reporting, and strategy. For startups that just raised, it's the fastest way to get board-ready without hiring full-time.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does a CFO do for a startup?",
    answer:
      "A CFO turns numbers into decisions. That includes understanding margins, managing cash runway, planning hires, and building investor-ready reports. At Crown, we bring this into your day-to-day.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a fractional CFO cost for a Series A–B startup?",
    answer:
      "If you're wondering about the CFO cost for startups, full-time hires typically run $250K–$400K per year plus equity. Our fractional CFO pricing starts around $5,000/month. Every plan includes reporting, monthly close, strategy calls, and scales up to support fundraising, systems, and HR oversight.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between bookkeeping and a CFO?",
    answer:
      "Bookkeeping tells you what happened. A CFO helps you plan what's next. Crown handles both, but we go further by supporting hiring, pricing, cash flow planning, and investor strategy.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is outsourced accounting enough for a startup?",
    answer:
      "If it's disconnected from strategy, no. Most fast-growing teams outgrow basic accounting and need a full-picture view of finance, HR, and operations. That's where Crown fits.",
  },
  {
    question: "What services are included in Crown's offer?",
    answer:
      "We support your entire finance function:<ul class='list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1'><li>Monthly close and reporting</li><li>Board updates and cash flow plans</li><li>Payroll and HR coordination</li><li>Audit and fundraising support</li><li>Systems integration and automation</li></ul>You get a team that fits your stage and evolves with your company.",
  },
  {
    question: "How fast can we get started?",
    answer:
      "Most startups are fully onboarded in under 30 days. That includes stabilizing your numbers, updating reports, and getting core systems in place.",
  },
